**SENTIMENT ANALYSIS**

**Code:** : sentiment_classification.ipynb

**Description**: Performed Sentiment Analysis of 50k IMDB Movie Reviews. Developed various classification models to predict if the given movie review is positive or negative.

**Skills** : Building machine learning and deep learning classification models, Text Mining, Python Programming, Text preprocessing, Feature Engineering, Data Cleaning and Natural Language Processing.

**Technology** : Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit Learn, Regex, Jupyter Notebook.

**Results** : Designed and modeled Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and LSTM. The baseline performance by the Naive Bayes model is 86%. Logistic Regression outperformed all other models by achieving a test accuracy of around 90%.
